## Technology Stack

Our text editor project will use a technology stack to ensure functionality and a smooth user experience. Here are the key frameworks and their roles:

### 1. **Next.js**

- **Role**: Frontend Development
- **Functionality**: Next.js facilitates dynamic web page rendering and efficient routing, enhancing the user interface.
- **Alternatives**: Alternatives to Next.js include traditional React applications or other frontend frameworks like Angular or Vue.js.

### 2. **DartJS**

- **Role**: Text Editing and Formatting
- **Functionality**: DartJS provides advanced text editing, formatting, and styling capabilities to improve the text editor's functionality.
- **Alternatives**: Alternatives to DartJS might include libraries like Quill.js or Draft.js for text editing and formatting.

### 3. **MongoDB**

- **Role**: Database Management
- **Functionality**: MongoDB stores user documents and metadata, offering scalability and flexibility for data management.
- **Alternatives**: Alternatives to MongoDB include SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL for structured data storage.

### 4. **Express.js**

- **Role**: Backend Development
- **Functionality**: Express.js handles API routing, authentication, and database interactions for secure and efficient data flow.
- **Alternatives**: Alternatives to Express.js are Nest.js or Hapi.js for backend development with Node.js.

By utilizing this technology stack, we aim to create a functional text editor with enhanced capabilities while considering alternative frameworks to ensure the best fit for our project.
